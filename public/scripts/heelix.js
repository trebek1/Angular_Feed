 * # Heelix (Our App File)
 *
 * This file bootstraps our Angular appliation; for the purposes of this demo, we created a simple
 * single controller-less module that contains a single Widget directive. The Widget directive
 * provides the general wrapper for the demo and some basic convenience methods.
 *
 * You can modify this file if needed, though you should assume that the heelixWidget directive is
 * used by many other widgets app-wide. If you do make any edits to it, they should be "safe" for
 * any other modules that might share this wrapper.
